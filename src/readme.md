hola Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
hola Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
Letraset sheets containing hola Ipsum passages, and more recently withdesktoppublishing software like Aldus PageMaker inc
luding versions of hola Ipsum.
